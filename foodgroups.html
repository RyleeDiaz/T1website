  The ‘protein group’ provides us with important nutrients such as protein, iron, zinc, fats, fibers, and vitamins. 
  Our body uses the proteins we digest from these foods to make lots of specialized chemicals that help make the body work. 
  Protein is essential for building, repairing,  and maintaining the tissues in your body. 
  The recommended daily serving for the ‘protein group’ is 1 and a half servings for children up to the age of 8, 
  and 2 and a half servings for older children and adults. <br><br>

  Confectionary, fats, and oils are at the very top of the pyramid (taking up the least space in your diet) 
  because they are not important or essential to obtain a healthy diet. 
  We recommend limiting your artificial sugar consumption as large amounts could cause long term health issues. 
  As well as sweets, unnecessary fats and oils should be avoided.  <br><br>
  Some examples of this food group are… lollies, sweets, fats, or oils.
